This is my first personal project.

This project is a final assignment which is assigned by my school's Android lesson.

There are stil some problems with this project: I don't have a very good handle on using SharedPreferences to storage data so that the login page is supposed to be improved.

In some cases, the project doesn't fit the real Android machine, like the font colors, layouts' sizes and so on. I still have work to do to improve this project.
